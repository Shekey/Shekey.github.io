## Introduction

Accessibility ensures that digital content is usable by people of all abilities and disabilities. By following accessibility principles, we can create more inclusive experiences for everyone.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusivity**: Ensures equal access for all users.
- **Legal Compliance**: Meets standards like WCAG, ADA, and Section 508.
- **Improved Usability**: Benefits all users, including those with temporary or situational disabilities.

## Best Practices

1. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements for structure and meaning.
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard.
3. **Color Contrast**: Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background.
4. **Alt Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for images.
5. **ARIA Roles**: Use ARIA roles and attributes appropriately.
6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure content adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
